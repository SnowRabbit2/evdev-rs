A Rust wrapper for libevdev

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
evdev-rs = "0.0.1"
```

Why a libevdev wrapper?
-----------------------
The evdev protocol is simple, but quirky, with a couple of behaviors that
are non-obvious. libevdev transparently handles some of those quirks.

The evdev crate on [1] is an implementation of evdev in Rust. Nothing wrong
with that, but it will miss out on any more complex handling that libevdev
provides.
